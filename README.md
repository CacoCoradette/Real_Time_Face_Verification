# Real-Time-Face-Verification
Face recognition is a 1:K way of identifying or confirming an individual's identity using the facial expressions. The model used in this project is highly inspired from "FaceNet Model". I have used 3 to 5 images of each of my friends to create my personal database for verification. I have applied data augmentation to enlarge my dataset. Finally I used Streamlit to deploy my project onto the web as an end to end application so that it can be used globally.
